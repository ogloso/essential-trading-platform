# essential-trading-platform

Hello, welcome to my project. At this moment it only allows for you to create account profiles for any general accounts the business may have
and store them in a tabled fashion. The accounts tab is the only one that works. This was made to demonstrate my basic skills in javascript and
html. I will revisit and continue the project after I have concluded my current courses in smart contract programming. 

At its final stage I hope to make a fully functional platform that allows for orders to be created, inventory to be stored, and alerts under inventory status
if ordering inventory is needed.
